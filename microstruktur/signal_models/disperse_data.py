def disperse_data(E, bvecs, shell_indices, mu, psi, kappa, beta):
    """Function to disperse micro-environment (multi-shell) data using a
    Bingham distribution. We use it to disperse data that was simulated using
    Camino [1], which only simulates parallel cylinders. We use convolution
    using spherical harmonics to make this function as general as possible.

    Parameters
    ----------
    E : array, shape (N)
        signal attenuation of a single-shell or multi-shell acquisition of the
        simulated micro-environment substrate. Will be used as kernel.
        data must be aligned with the z-axis, i.e. mu = (0, 0)
    bvecs : array, shape (Nx3)
        gradient orientations associated with E.
    shell_indices : array, shape (N)
        index of the shell that is associated with each gradient direction.
        0 for b0 measurement. [1, 2, ... etc] for subsequent b-shells.
    mu : tuple
        desired orientation of dispersed micro-environment in radians.
        (theta, phi) ranges are [0, pi] and [-pi, pi].
    psi : float
        rotation of the distribution about the axis mu. Only has an influence
        if beta>0. range is [0, pi].
    kappa : float
        principal concentration parameter. range is [0, 16] for realistic
        tissue dispersion [2].
    beta : float
        secondary concentration parameter for anisotropic dispersion.
        in general beta<kappa should be true [2].

    Returns
    -------
    E_dispersed : array, shape (N)
        dispersed signal attenuation of micro-environment data E.
