    "The simplest model for intra-axonal diffusion is the ``Stick'' -- a cylinder with zero radius~\\citep{behrens2003characterization}.\n",
    "The Stick model assumes that, because axon diameters are very small, the perpendicular diffusion attenuation inside these axons is negligible compared to the overall signal attenuation.\n",

    "In reality, axons have a non-zero radius.\n",
    "To account for this, different cylinder models for perpendicular diffusion have been proposed for different combinations of PGSE acquisition parameters.\n",
    "The simplest is the ``Soderman'' model~\\citep{soderman1995restricted}, which has the hardest assumptions on the PGSE protocol.\n",
    "First, it assumes that pulse length $\\delta$ is so short that no diffusion occurs during the application of the gradient pulse ($\\delta\\rightarrow0$).\n",
    "%Recalling work \\ref{sec:p1c1:dmri}, this allows us to interpret the diffusion propagator as the Fourier transform of the diffusion signal attenuation $E(\\textbf{q},\\Delta)$~\\citep{tanner1968restricted}.\n",
    "Second, it assumes that pulse separation $\\Delta$ is long enough for diffusion with intra-cylindrical diffusion coefficient $D$ to be restricted inside a cylinder of radius $R$ ($\\Delta\\gg R^2/D$).\n",

The Callaghan model has been used to estimate the axon diameter distribution in the multi-compartment AxCaliber approach~\\citep{assaf2008axcaliber}. However, the authors also mention that the perpendicular diffusion is likely already restricted for realistic axon diameters ($<2\\mu$m)~\\citep{aboitiz1992fiber} for the shortest possible $\\Delta$ in PGSE protocols (${\\sim}10$ms). This limits the added value of the Callaghan model over the Soderman model in axon diameter estimation."
